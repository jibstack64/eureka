### This repo contains the source code for my (honestly low-quality) games, anonymous chatting and url unblocking site.

This project is **still in development**, so dont expect any official site to be hosted for at least half-a-dozen days.

### Todo:
- [x] Create flask server
- [x] Setup logging system
- [x] Create home page
- [ ] Create messaging page
- [ ] Backend messaging system
- [ ] Add games
- [ ] Create and setup unblocker proxy (seperate Go server)

#### Current URL: *N/A*.
